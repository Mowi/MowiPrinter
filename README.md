MowiPrinter
===========

The Mowi Printer is a foldable 3d printer, folded flat it is small, but opened up it can print big and with two materials. It also has a display for standalone printing. The Mowi printer is still under development so expect the files to change. I also did some manual changes that are not reflected in the files yet.

More information can be found on http://reprap.org/wiki/Mowi_printer

At the moment there is no build manual yet. In the Step Assembly you can see how everything fits together. If you have any issues please post them on the github. All help in improving the design and/or the documentation is welcome.
